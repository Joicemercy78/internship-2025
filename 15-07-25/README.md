### What is DOM? 

- Document Object Model 
    - Programming interface for web document.
    - Programs like JS can change the documents structure style and content
    - tree-like-structure
        <Document>
        (object)
            |
          <html>
            | 
    <head>      <body>

    - every single element, attribute and piece of text becomesb a node or an object in this tree.
- DOM methods and properties:
    - createElement()          : Create a new html element node 
    - appendChild()            : Adds a node as the last child of a parent node
    - setAttribute()           : Sets the value of a specified attribute on an element.
    - addEventListener()       : Attaches an event handler function to an element
    - createDocumentFragment() : it as a temporary, invisible storage box for HTML elements
    - .className               : getting or setting the CSS class attribute of an element
    - .textContent             : getting or setting the text content of a node
    - .innerHTML               : getting or setting the HTML content within an element
